    "Tom Mitchell provides the definition as : \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n",

    "Essentially, Machine Learning is a program that learns to do a task by experience. The key thing that distinguishes machine learning from a typical computer program is that, it is not programmed with logic to perform the task as a traditional program would, it is instead programmed to learn so that the computer can perform the task.\n",
