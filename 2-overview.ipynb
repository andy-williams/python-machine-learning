    "Tom Mitchell provides the definition as : \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, Machine Learning is a program that learns to do a task by experience. The key thing that distinguishes machine learning from a typical computer program is that, it is not programmed with logic to perform the task as a traditional program would, it is instead programmed to learn so that the computer can perform the task.\n",

    "## Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the data set already contain the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some problems that supervised machine learning solve include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Classification problem is when a problem involves having to classify from a set of features. For example, I want to be able to tell whether a fruit is an apple, banana or orange based on certain features, such as colour, density and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem is a regression problem when we are trying to predict a continues value - for example, we have a set of features of a car; make, model, condition, colour and it's price from year 2000 to 2017, we want to predict what the value will be in the next *n* years.\n",
